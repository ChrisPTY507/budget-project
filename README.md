# JS Budget application - A Javascript Project #

This is a pretty interesting application i did in my free time. My main reason behind the creation of this project is to apply what i have learnt about **Javascript** and further improve it through constant practice, trial, and error.

for instance: no framework was used in the development of this app, just full and vanilla Javascript. Concepts about the regular JS must be fully grasped in order to climb all those popular frameworks such as Angular, React, Vue, etc.

## The way it works ##

It's pretty simple: The application allows us to add incomes and expenses for the actual month, then the sum of incomes and expenses are calculated alongside the available budget (total income - total expenses).

With a straightforward and intuitive UI, we can input an amount that can be either an expense or an income, add a description, and finally, the amount itself.

Each individual expense amount will have the percentage it represents from the total income, and the total expense will have the sum of all the percentages in each inserted expense.

We are also allowed to delete an income or expense already added in the budget.

## Created using the Module Pattern ##

I chose to code this project using the **Module Pattern** because i wanted separation of concerns, and more organization in general while coding. The idea of creating modules is to group the code in separate, independent and organized units while also serving a common objective.
